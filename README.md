# TypeScript Blockchain

Project implementing and testing a simple algorithm based on Blockchain concepts.

Following each development step from the [@khaosdoctor](https://github.com/khaosdoctor)'s [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztQEaQ06GYs&ab_channel=LucasSantos).

# Run the app

To run the app, with docker installed, run the command `docker-compose up`, and the tests will run showing the logs.

Feel free to change `blocksQuantity` and `difficulty` variables on the [tests/blockchain.spec.ts](https://github.com/ologbonowiwi/typescript-blockchain-implementation/blob/main/tests/blockchain.spec.ts) file to see how system will works :)
